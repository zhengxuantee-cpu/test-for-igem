### How well were engineering principles used (e.g., design-build-test cycle, use of standards, modularity, etc.)?

To demonstrate the effective use of engineering principles, we should clearly present our project on the wiki as an **iterative engineering process** structured around the **Design–Build–Test–Learn** cycle. This includes explicitly **explaining the initial design rationale, the constraints considered (Design)**, **how the system was constructed (Build)**, and **how its performance was evaluated (Test)** through experiments or modeling. We should further show **how insights gained from testing informed subsequent design refinements (Learn)**, emphasizing **modularity** by decomposing the system into functional units that can be independently designed, tested, and replaced, and **standardization** by using well-characterized parts, consistent design rules, and reproducible protocols that allow the system to be reliably understood, reused, and extended by others, rather than relying on rough trial-and-error approaches.

### Did the team design a project based on synthetic biology and standard components (BioBricks, software, etc.)?

To demonstrate that the project is grounded in **synthetic biology and standard components**, we should describe the system on the wiki as a deliberately designed **biological system composed of multiple functional modules**, each responsible for a specific role. We should **clearly explain the purpose of each module and how standardized or well-characterized biological parts, genetic elements, and software tools are assembled to work together as a complete system.** By presenting the project in this way, we show that the design focuses on **system and modular level function** rather than individual biological details, and that **each module can be independently tested, adjusted, or reused in other contexts**. This approach demonstrates core synthetic biology principles, including modular design, standardization, and the ability to build complex functions from simpler, well-defined components.

### Did the project work or is it likely to work?

To demonstrate that the project works or is likely to work, we should present clear experimental results and/or modeling outputs that **validate key components of the system**. Where complete system-level (Full wet lab and dry lab) validation is not feasible (Due to iGEM’s one-year project cycle), we should explain how **partial results** (one module works), **proof-of-concept experiments** (Explain how each components works by demonstrating it), and **literature support** (Recent frontiers and published studies in the field) collectively justify the **feasibility** of the overall design. The wiki should transparently discuss both **successes and limitations**, showing that **conclusions are based on scientific reasoning rather than overstatement.**

### How well did the team's data (modeled and/or experimentally measured) support their claims?

To demonstrate that the team’s data support their claims, we should ensure that **every major conclusion on the wiki is DIRECTLY LINKED to quantitative experimental or modeled data (IMPORTANT)**. Figures, tables, and analyses should be **clearly labeled**, **appropriately controlled where applicable (Design control and experimental groups to demonstrate that the observed function is attributable to the engineered bacteria.)**, and **explicitly referenced in the text**. We should explain **how the data were obtained** and **how they support specific claims**, allowing judges to easily trace conclusions back to evidence.

### Is the project likely to have an impact?

To demonstrate that the project is likely to have an impact, we should clearly define the **real-world problem** the project addresses and **explain why a synthetic biology approach is appropriate**. On the wiki, we should discuss **potential applications (Identify the industries that could benefit from this project and explain the potential extent of its impact)**, **relevant stakeholders (Important for Human Practices)**, and **how the project could be expanded or adapted beyond the iGEM competition (Future development)**. The emphasis should be on realistic, well-reasoned impact rather than broad or speculative claims.

### How much of the project was initiated and led by the students?

To demonstrate that the project was initiated and led by students, we should explicitly **highlight student ownership throughout the wiki**. This includes describing how students **generated the original idea**, **made key design and experimental decisions**, and **led troubleshooting and optimization processes**. The role of advisors should be clearly framed as **guidance** rather than direction, reinforcing that the project reflects student initiative, leadership, and learning.
